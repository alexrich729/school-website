# school-website

## Assumption
Student, course, school, etc., are all very simple types to start, but are likely to
get many more fields as we improve the website.

## Main ideas
1. Make all of these entities highly configurable, so we can add new fields just by changing the yaml config file.
2. The config file can drive all parts of the system:  the business logic, the web API interface, and the GUI (webpage), thus
 ensuring all three systems stay in perfect synch, with no code!

## Original goals

1. Simple website includes a mock server and html UI
2. The static website can be used to manage a list of schools, users (students and professors), and courses associated with each.
3. The APIs can also be directly invoked to manage the entities, and are used by the website.

TODO: include website screenshots here (website not built yet)

## Result
I found it complicated to build the type system in java, so I spent a lot of time developing the type system and didn't have
   time to tackle the web API or GUI, or even unit test all my classes, but I did unit test a couple of the top-level classes
   to give confidence that the type system and business logic are working at a high level.



# How to build and use

## build the code

`./gradlew assemble`

## run tests

`./gradlew build`

## view tests

The output will be at `build/reports/tests/test/index.html`.
Test source code is at `src/test/java`.

## run the server

TODO: web server not built yet
`./gradle run`

# Project Structure

# Object Model
![Class Hierarchy-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67568819/158113306-76194fa8-57be-45d3-8548-4d2593444aff.jpg)



# Workplan

## APIs to implement

Per the assignment:

* [x] Add a user
* [x] Update a user
* [x] List the users
* [x] Delete a user
Search APIs like below
* [x] Find all the students in the given school
* [x] Find Students
* [x] Find Professors

## Additional APIs to implement

Per the assignment to implement other APIs that I could "think of"

* [ ] all the above for a course
* [ ] all the above for a school
* [ ] attach or detach course to/from user
* [ ] attach or detach course to/from school
* [ ] suggestions APIs for each field:Â  name, email, school, course - given a string, what matches do we have in the database?
* [ ] add enrollment year to user fields
* [ ] add course year to courses

## Other things to take care of

These are roughly in priority order
* [x] javadoc everything
* [x] typecheck everything coming into the API
* [x] put tests and data separate from source code
* [ ] use separate file for web server, core logic, and data-source
* [x] use a mock library with test data to make the mock "database" / search engine
* [x] provide validators
** [ ] make sure that the data has no special characters for security
** [ ] make sure that the data can convert to the expected type if it's an email or a year
* [x] make the objects configurable
* [ ] drive the API and the UI off the object configuration
* [x] use gradle build system to compile, test, and run the server
* [x] use yaml for the configuration
* [ ] build the API with GraphQL interface
* [ ] create a diagram to show the structure of the systems and the code that powers them
* [ ] implement suggestions in the UI

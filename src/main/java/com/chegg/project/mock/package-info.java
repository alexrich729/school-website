/**
 * A mock implementation of this project.  Differences from a real implementation:
 * 
 * 1. No database -- all data will be in memory and search algorithms will be brute-force instead of based on viable indexes.
 * 2. Pre-loaded with some sample data -- used for unit testing, and to give the UI something to work with.
